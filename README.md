# Propositional Logic Translator
A tool that can translate natural language statements into propositional logic symbols. The tool will also be equipped with logic rules validation features to check the validity of the generated propositions.

Propositional Logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with propositions or statements that are either true or false. It is also called "sentential logic" or "propositional calculus." In propositional logic, statements are represented using symbols such as "P," "Q," "R," etc., and logical operators such as "not," "and," "or," and "implies" are used to connect these statements.

## The rules of propositional logic include:

* Negation: If P is a proposition, then the negation of P is denoted by ¬P and means "not P."
* Conjunction: If P and Q are propositions, then the conjunction of P and Q is denoted by P ∧ Q and means "P and Q."
* Disjunction: If P and Q are propositions, then the disjunction of P and Q is denoted by P ∨ Q and means "P or Q."
* Implication: If P and Q are propositions, then the implication of P and Q is denoted by P → Q and means "if P, then Q."
* The benefits of propositional logic include its simplicity and clarity, which make it easy to understand and use. It is also useful in AI because it can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in a formal and precise way

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the translator and validator:
